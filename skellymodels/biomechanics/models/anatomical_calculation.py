class AnatomicalCalculation(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for anatomical calculations.

    Subclasses must implement both a `calculate()` method to produce
    results from an Aspect, and a `store()` method to write those
    results back into the Aspect.

    Example implementations include:
    - Center of mass estimation
    - Rigid body reconstruction
    - Segment angle derivation

        Perform the calculation using data in the provided Aspect.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aspect : Aspect
            The anatomical data container to operate on.

        Returns
        -------
        CalculationResult

        Save the calculation results into the Aspect object.

        This typically updates `aspect.trajectories` or other

        ----------
        aspect : Aspect
            The aspect into which to store results.

        ----------
        aspect : Aspect
            Aspect to process and optionally modify.
