    A Keypoint is a named "key" location on a skeleton, used to define the position of a rigid body or linkage.
    In marker-based motion capture, keypoints could correspond to markers placed on the body.
    In markerless motion capture, keypoints could correspond to a tracked point in the image.
    When a Keypoint is hydrated with data, it becomes a Trajectory.

    `definition` is a human-oriented description of the keypoint's location (e.g. an anatomical
    description of a landmark on a bone).
